# README - LAYER-2-COMPLETE

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of the LAYER-2-COMPLETE system with integrated BuyBot Enterprise. The system is designed to support token launches on Solana, with advanced features to ensure launch success and token price growth.

## Main Components

The system consists of the following main components:

Launchpad: Module for creating and launching tokens, with full support for presales, contributions, finalization, and launch.

BuyBot: Intelligent system that supports the launch and growth of the token price, composed of:
•	Bundle Engine: Aggregates transactions into bundles for efficient processing.
•	Tax System: Manages transaction taxes with buyback and burn functionalities.
•	Anti-Rug System: Assesses rug pull risk and includes Lock Liquidity features.
•	Market Maker: Manages liquidity creation and price stabilization.

Token Contract: Solana smart contract with integrated BuyBot support, which includes:
•	Progressive taxation
•	Automatic buyback and burn
•	Anti-dump protection
•	Price support
•	Dedicated launch mode

BuyBot-Token Integration: Integration layer that directly links the BuyBot to the token contract to support the price during and after the launch.

## How to Use

System Initialization


```typescript
import { createLayer2System } from './src/index';
import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Create a keypair for the operator
const operatorKeypair = Keypair.generate();

// Initialize the Layer-2 system with BuyBot
const layer2System = createLayer2System(
  'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com',
  operatorKeypair
);

// Access the components
const { bundleEngine, taxSystem, antiRugSystem, marketMaker, launchpad } = layer2System;
```

### Token Creation and Launch

```typescript
// Create a new token
const tokenAddress = await launchpad.createToken({
  name: 'My Token',
  symbol: 'MTK',
  decimals: 9,
  initialSupply: BigInt(1000000000000),
  maxSupply: BigInt(1000000000000),
  owner: operatorKeypair.publicKey.toString(),
  tokenomics: {
    team: 10,
    marketing: 10,
    development: 10,
    liquidity: 30,
    presale: 40
  },
  taxes: {
    buy: 5,
    sell: 10,
    transfer: 2,
    distribution: {
      liquidity: 30,
      marketing: 20,
      development: 20,
      burn: 15,
      buyback: 15
    }
  },
  antiRugConfig: {
    liquidityLockPeriod: 180 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 180 giorni
    maxWalletSize: 2,
    maxTransactionSize: 1
  },
  buybotEnabled: true
});

// Create a presale for the token
const presaleId = await launchpad.createPresale({
  tokenAddress,
  softCap: BigInt(100000000000),
  hardCap: BigInt(200000000000),
  minContribution: BigInt(1000000000),
  maxContribution: BigInt(10000000000),
  presalePrice: 0.0005,
  listingPrice: 0.001,
  startTime: Date.now() + 86400000, // Inizia tra 1 giorno
  endTime: Date.now() + 604800000, // Termina tra 7 giorni
  liquidityPercentage: 80,
  liquidityLockPeriod: 180 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 180 giorni
});

// Finalize the presale and launch the token
await launchpad.finalizePresale(presaleId);
await launchpad.launchToken(tokenAddress);

// Create an integration between BuyBot and token
const tokenIntegration = layer2System.createTokenIntegration(
  tokenAddress,
  'TokenProgramId111111111111111111111111111'
);

// Enable launch mode
await tokenIntegration.enableLaunchMode(0.001); // Prezzo di listing
```

### Price Support

```typescript
// Execute a buyback
await tokenIntegration.executeBuyback(BigInt(1000000000));

// Execute a burn
await tokenIntegration.executeBurn(BigInt(500000000));

// Execute a price support intervention
await tokenIntegration.executePriceSupport(BigInt(1000000000));

// Get BuyBot statistics
const stats = await tokenIntegration.getBuybotStatistics();
console.log(stats);
```
