# Layer-2 on Solana: Complete Documentation

## Overview

Layer-2 on Solana is an implementation of an Optimistic Rollup that utilizes the Solana Virtual Machine. This system enables increased scalability for the Solana ecosystem while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.

## System Architecture

The system consists of several main components:

1. **Fraud Proof System**: Verifies transaction validity and allows contesting invalid transactions.
2. **Finalization System**: Manages block finalization and state commitment.
3. **Bridge**: Handles asset transfers between Layer-1 (Solana) and Layer-2.
4. **Standardized Interfaces**: Ensure consistency and interoperability between components.
5. **Error Handling**: Provides robust mechanisms for error handling and recovery.

## Main Components

### Fraud Proof System

The Fraud Proof System is responsible for verifying transaction validity and contesting invalid transactions. It uses a bisection game to identify the exact point of disagreement in a sequence of transactions.

**Main files**:
- `src/fraud_proof_system/mod.rs`: Main module of the Fraud Proof System
- `src/fraud_proof_system/fraud_proof.rs`: Implementation of fraud proofs
- `src/fraud_proof_system/bisection.rs`: Implementation of the bisection game
- `src/fraud_proof_system/merkle_tree.rs`: Implementation of the Merkle tree
- `src/fraud_proof_system/state_transition.rs`: Management of state transitions
- `src/fraud_proof_system/verification.rs`: Verification of fraud proofs
- `src/fraud_proof_system/solana_runtime_wrapper.rs`: Wrapper for the Solana runtime

### Finalization System

The Finalization System manages block finalization and state commitment. It ensures that blocks are finalized only after a challenge period.

**Main files**:
- `src/finalization/mod.rs`: Main module of the Finalization System
- `src/finalization/block_finalization.rs`: Block finalization
- `src/finalization/state_commitment.rs`: State commitment
- `src/finalization/output_oracle.rs`: Oracle for Layer-2 outputs

### Bridge

The Bridge handles asset transfers between Layer-1 (Solana) and Layer-2. It supports token deposits and withdrawals.

**Main files**:
- `src/bridge/mod.rs`: Main module of the Bridge
- `src/bridge/deposit_handler.rs`: Deposit handling
- `src/bridge/withdrawal_handler.rs`: Withdrawal handling

### Standardized Interfaces

Standardized interfaces ensure consistency and interoperability between system components.

**Main files**:
- `src/interfaces/component_interface.rs`: Generic interfaces for all components
- `src/interfaces/fraud_proof_interface.rs`: Specific interfaces for the Fraud Proof System
- `src/interfaces/finalization_interface.rs`: Specific interfaces for the Finalization System
- `src/interfaces/bridge_interface.rs`: Specific interfaces for the Bridge

### Error Handling

Error handling provides robust mechanisms for error management and recovery.

**Main files**:
- `src/error_handling/error_types.rs`: Standard error types
- `src/error_handling/error_handler.rs`: Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Execution Flow

1. **Asset Deposit**:
   - A user deposits assets on Layer-1
   - The Bridge detects the deposit and creates a corresponding asset on Layer-2

2. **Transaction Execution**:
   - Transactions are executed on Layer-2
   - Transaction results are published on Layer-1

3. **Verification and Contestation**:
   - Anyone can verify transaction validity
   - If an invalid transaction is detected, it can be contested via a fraud proof

4. **Finalization**:
   - After a challenge period, blocks are finalized
   - Finalized states are committed to Layer-1

5. **Asset Withdrawal**:
   - A user can withdraw assets from Layer-2 to Layer-1
   - The Bridge verifies withdrawal validity and releases assets on Layer-1

## Configuration and Usage

### System Requirements

- Solana CLI
- Rust 1.60 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/buybotsolana/LAYER-2-COMPLETE.git
cd LAYER-2-COMPLETE

# Install dependencies
cargo build --release
npm install
```

### Configuration

1. Configure the Solana node:
```bash
solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

2. Configure Layer-2:
```bash
./setup_layer2.sh
```

### Execution

1. Start the Layer-2 node:
```bash
./start_layer2.sh
```

2. Interact with Layer-2:
```bash
./layer2_cli.sh deposit --amount 1 --token SOL
./layer2_cli.sh transfer --to <ADDRESS> --amount 0.5 --token SOL
./layer2_cli.sh withdraw --amount 0.5 --token SOL
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
cargo test --test integration_test
```

### Stress Tests

```bash
./stress_test.sh
```

## Security

The system implements several security measures:

1. **Fraud Proofs**: Allow contesting invalid transactions
2. **Challenge Period**: Provides sufficient time to verify transactions
3. **Error Handling**: Implements robust mechanisms for error handling
4. **Authorizations**: Verifies authorizations for critical operations

## Current Limitations

1. Limited support for non-native tokens
2. Finalization latency due to the challenge period
3. Dependency on Layer-1 availability

## Future Roadmap

1. Support for more complex smart contracts
2. Performance improvements
3. Integration with other ecosystems
4. Implementation of ZK-rollups to reduce finalization latency
