    previous_state,
    transaction,
    new_state
);

// Start a bisection game
let bisection_game = fraud_proof_system.start_bisection_game(
    disputed_block_range,

    block_header,
    state_root
);

// Create a checkpoint
let checkpoint = finalization_system.create_checkpoint(
    block_number,
    state_root
);

    token_address,
    amount
);

// Withdraw assets from L2 to L1
let withdrawal_result = bridge.withdraw(
    user_address,
    token_address,
