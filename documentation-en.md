# Layer-2 on Solana - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This documentation describes the implementation of a Layer-2 protocol (optimistic rollup) on Solana. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Fraud Proof System**: Allows verification and contestation of invalid state transitions
2. **Finalization Logic**: Defines when an L2 block is considered final and irreversible
3. **Trustless Bridge**: Enables secure asset transfer between Ethereum (L1) and Layer-2 on Solana

This implementation ensures security, efficiency, and censorship resistance, allowing users to benefit from Solana's scalability while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees.

## 1. Fraud Proof System

### 1.1 Overview

The Fraud Proof System is the fundamental component that ensures the security of the Layer-2. It allows verification that all state transitions are valid and contestation of invalid ones through cryptographic proofs.

### 1.2 Main Components

#### 1.2.1 Merkle Trees

Merkle trees are used to efficiently represent and verify state roots. The optimized implementation includes:

- Node caching to avoid redundant calculations
- Efficient proof generation
- Fast proof verification
- Support for leaf updates

```rust
pub struct OptimizedMerkleTree {
    /// Leaves of the tree
    leaves: Vec<[u8; 32]>,
    
    /// Nodes of the tree (cached)
    nodes: HashMap<(usize, usize), [u8; 32]>,
    
    /// Root of the tree (cached)
    root: [u8; 32],
    
    /// Height of the tree
    height: usize,
}
```

#### 1.2.2 State Transition

The state transition module handles transaction execution and calculation of new state roots. It includes:

- Deterministic transaction execution
- State root calculation
- Execution error handling

```rust
pub struct StateTransition {
    /// Pre-transition state root
    pub pre_state_root: [u8; 32],
    
    /// Transaction to execute
    pub transaction: Transaction,
    
    /// Block number
    pub block_number: u64,
    
    /// Timestamp
    pub timestamp: u64,
}
```

#### 1.2.3 Fraud Proofs

The fraud proof module handles the generation and verification of fraud proofs. It supports different types of fraud:

- Execution fraud: when a transaction is executed incorrectly
- State transition fraud: when the resulting state root is incorrect
- Data availability fraud: when necessary data is not available
- Derivation fraud: when derived data is incorrect

```rust
pub struct FraudProof {
    /// Type of fraud proof
    pub proof_type: FraudProofType,
    
    /// Pre-transition state root
    pub pre_state_root: [u8; 32],
    
    /// Post-transition state root (incorrect)
    pub post_state_root: [u8; 32],
    
    /// Expected post-transition state root (correct)
    pub expected_post_state_root: [u8; 32],
    
    /// Transaction that caused the fraud
    pub transaction: Transaction,
    
    /// Execution trace
    pub execution_trace: Vec<ExecutionStep>,
}
```

#### 1.2.4 Solana Runtime Wrapper

The Solana Runtime wrapper allows deterministic execution of transactions, ensuring that the same input always produces the same output. This is essential for fraud proof verification.

```rust
pub struct SolanaRuntimeWrapper {
    /// Execution mode
    pub mode: ExecutionMode,
    
    /// Runtime configuration
    pub config: RuntimeConfig,
}
```

#### 1.2.5 Bisection Game

The bisection game is an interactive protocol that identifies the exact point of disagreement in a sequence of state transitions. This significantly reduces the cost of verifying fraud proofs.

```rust
pub struct BisectionGame {
    /// Pre-transition state root
    pub pre_state_root: [u8; 32],
    
    /// Post-transition state root (contested)
    pub post_state_root: [u8; 32],
    
    /// Expected post-transition state root
    pub expected_post_state_root: [u8; 32],
    
    /// Transactions to execute
    pub transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    
    /// Game state
    pub state: BisectionGameState,
    
    /// Game steps
    pub steps: Vec<BisectionStep>,
}
```

#### 1.2.6 Verification

The verification module provides functions to verify fraud proofs and determine whether a state transition is valid or not.

```rust
pub fn verify_fraud_proof(
    proof: &FraudProof,
) -> Result<ProofVerificationResult, FraudProofError> {
    // Verification implementation
}
```

### 1.3 Optimizations

The Fraud Proof System includes several optimizations to improve efficiency:

- **State Root Caching**: Calculated state roots are cached to avoid recalculations
- **Optimized Merkle Tree**: Optimized implementation of Merkle trees with node caching
- **Efficient Bisection**: The bisection game reduces the amount of data to verify
- **Parallel Execution**: Support for parallel transaction execution when possible

## 2. Finalization Logic

### 2.1 Overview

The Finalization Logic defines when an L2 block is considered final and irreversible. This is essential to ensure that transactions cannot be reversed after a certain period of time.

### 2.2 Main Components

#### 2.2.1 Block Finalization

The block finalization module manages the process of proposing, challenging, and finalizing L2 blocks.

```rust
pub struct OptimizedBlockFinalization {
    /// Challenge period in seconds
    pub challenge_period: u64,
    
    /// Block cache (block_hash -> block_details)
    block_cache: HashMap<[u8; 32], BlockDetails>,
    
    /// Finalized blocks by number (block_number -> block_hash)
    finalized_blocks: BTreeMap<u64, [u8; 32]>,
    
    /// Challenged blocks (block_hash -> challenge_details)
    challenged_blocks: HashMap<[u8; 32], ChallengeDetails>,
}
```

#### 2.2.2 State Commitment

The state commitment module manages the chain of state roots and verifies state transitions.

```rust
pub struct OptimizedStateCommitment {
    /// State root cache (block_number -> state_root)
    state_root_cache: BTreeMap<u64, [u8; 32]>,
    
    /// Verified state transitions (from_state_root -> to_state_root)
    verified_transitions: HashMap<[u8; 32], [u8; 32]>,
}
```

#### 2.2.3 L2 Output Oracle

The L2 output oracle is the source of truth for L2 outputs on L1. It manages the submission and finalization of L2 outputs.

```rust
pub struct OptimizedL2OutputOracle {
    /// Challenge period in seconds
    pub challenge_period: u64,
    
    /// Output cache (index -> output_details)
    output_cache: BTreeMap<u64, OutputDetails>,
    
    /// Block number to output index mapping
    block_to_output: HashMap<u64, u64>,
    
    /// Latest finalized output index
    latest_finalized_output: Option<u64>,
}
```

#### 2.2.4 Finalization Manager

The finalization manager coordinates the three previous components to ensure consistent finalization.

```rust
pub struct OptimizedFinalizationManager {
    /// Challenge period in seconds
    pub challenge_period: u64,
    
    /// Block finalization
    pub block_finalization: OptimizedBlockFinalization,
    
    /// State commitment
    pub state_commitment: OptimizedStateCommitment,
    
    /// L2 output oracle
    pub output_oracle: OptimizedL2OutputOracle,
}
```

### 2.3 Finalization Process

The finalization process follows these steps:

1. An L2 block is proposed with its state root
2. The challenge period begins (7 days in production, 1 day in testnet)
3. During the challenge period, anyone can challenge the block by presenting a fraud proof
4. If the block is not challenged within the challenge period, it is finalized
5. If the block is successfully challenged, it is invalidated

### 2.4 Optimizations

The Finalization Logic includes several optimizations to reduce latency:

- **Block Caching**: Blocks are cached for quick access
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use of BTreeMap for efficient ordered access
- **Parallel Verification**: Support for parallel verification of fraud proofs
- **Incremental Finalization**: Blocks are finalized incrementally to reduce latency

## 3. Trustless Bridge

### 3.1 Overview

The Trustless Bridge enables secure asset transfer between Ethereum (L1) and Layer-2 on Solana. It is completely trustless, meaning it does not require trust in third parties to ensure the security of funds.

### 3.2 Main Components

#### 3.2.1 Deposit Bridge (L1 → L2)

The deposit bridge handles asset transfer from Ethereum to Layer-2 on Solana.

```solidity
contract L1ToL2DepositBridge is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable {
    // Structure to store deposit information
    struct Deposit {
        address sender;
        address token;
        uint256 amount;
        bytes32 l2Recipient;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32 depositHash;
        bool processed;
    }
    
    // Array of deposits
    Deposit[] public deposits;
    
    // Mapping of deposit hash to deposit index
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public depositHashToIndex;
    
    // Mapping of supported tokens
    mapping(address => bool) public supportedTokens;
    
    // Mapping of token addresses to their L2 token addresses
    mapping(address => bytes32) public tokenL2Addresses;
    
    // Address of the L2 bridge contract on Solana
    bytes32 public l2BridgeAddress;
}
```

On the Solana side, the deposit handler processes deposit events and mints corresponding tokens.

```rust
pub struct OptimizedDepositHandler {
    /// L1 bridge address
    pub l1_bridge_address: [u8; 20],
    
    /// Token mapping cache
    token_mapping_cache: HashMap<[u8; 20], Pubkey>,
    
    /// Deposit cache
    deposit_cache: HashMap<[u8; 32], bool>,
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Withdrawal Bridge (L2 → L1)

The withdrawal bridge handles asset transfer from Layer-2 on Solana to Ethereum.

```solidity
contract L2ToL1WithdrawalBridge is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable {
    // Structure to store withdrawal information
    struct Withdrawal {
        address recipient;
        address token;
        uint256 amount;
        bytes32 l2BlockHash;
        uint256 l2BlockNumber;
        bytes32 withdrawalHash;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bool processed;
    }
    
    // Array of withdrawals
    Withdrawal[] public withdrawals;
    
    // Mapping of withdrawal hash to withdrawal index
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public withdrawalHashToIndex;
    
    // Mapping of processed withdrawal hashes
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public processedWithdrawals;
    
    // Mapping of supported tokens
    mapping(address => bool) public supportedTokens;
    
    // Mapping of token addresses to their L2 token addresses
    mapping(address => bytes32) public tokenL2Addresses;
    
    // Address of the L2OutputOracle contract
    address public l2OutputOracleAddress;
    
    // Address of the L1 deposit bridge contract
    address public l1DepositBridgeAddress;
    
    // Challenge period (in seconds)
    uint256 public challengePeriod = 7 days;
}
```

On the Solana side, the withdrawal handler manages withdrawal requests and generates necessary proofs.

```rust
pub struct OptimizedWithdrawalHandler {
    /// L1 withdrawal bridge address
    pub l1_withdrawal_bridge_address: [u8; 20],
    
    /// Token mapping cache
    token_mapping_cache: HashMap<Pubkey, [u8; 20]>,
    
    /// Withdrawal cache
    withdrawal_cache: HashMap<[u8; 32], bool>,
    
    /// Block finalization cache
    block_finalization_cache: HashMap<u64, bool>,
}
```

### 3.3 Deposit Process (L1 → L2)

The deposit process follows these steps:

1. The user deposits ETH or ERC20 tokens into the bridge contract on Ethereum
2. The bridge contract emits a deposit event
3. The deposit handler on Solana detects the event
4. The deposit handler mints corresponding tokens on Layer-2
5. The tokens are available to the user on Layer-2

### 3.4 Withdrawal Process (L2 → L1)

The withdrawal process follows these steps:

1. The user initiates a withdrawal on Layer-2, burning the tokens
2. The withdrawal handler records the withdrawal request
3. The L2 block containing the withdrawal is finalized
4. After the challenge period, the user can complete the withdrawal on Ethereum
5. The bridge contract verifies the withdrawal proof and releases the tokens to the user

### 3.5 Optimizations

The Trustless Bridge includes several optimizations to reduce gas costs:

- **Token Caching**: Token mappings are cached for quick access
- **Batch Processing**: Support for batch processing of deposits and withdrawals
- **Transfer Optimization**: Specific optimizations for token transfers
- **Efficient Verification**: Use of optimized Merkle trees for inclusion verification

## 4. Component Integration

### 4.1 Overview

Component integration is managed by the main `lib.rs` module, which provides a unified interface for the Layer-2.

```rust
pub struct Layer2System {
    /// Configuration
    pub config: Layer2Config,
    
    /// Fraud proof system
    pub fraud_proof_system: FraudProofSystem,
    
    /// Deposit handler
    pub deposit_handler: bridge::DepositHandler,
    
    /// Withdrawal handler
    pub withdrawal_handler: bridge::WithdrawalHandler,
    
    /// Finalization manager
    pub finalization_manager: finalization::FinalizationManager,
}
```

### 4.2 Execution Flow

The execution flow of the Layer-2 is as follows:

1. Transactions are submitted to the Layer-2
2. Transactions are executed and included in blocks
3. Blocks are proposed with their state roots
4. The challenge period begins
5. If a block contains invalid state transitions, it can be challenged
6. If a block is not challenged, it is finalized
7. Users can deposit assets from L1 to L2 and withdraw from L2 to L1

### 4.3 Component Interaction

The components interact with each other in the following ways:

- The **Fraud Proof System** verifies state transitions and generates fraud proofs
- The **Finalization Logic** uses fraud proofs to invalidate fraudulent blocks
- The **Trustless Bridge** uses the Finalization Logic to ensure withdrawals are secure

## 5. Testing and Verification

### 5.1 Unit Tests

Each component includes comprehensive unit tests that verify the correct functioning of each feature.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_optimized_merkle_tree() {
    // Test for the optimized Merkle tree implementation
